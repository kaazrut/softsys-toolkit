How To Use

Image files should be stored in directories pertaining to the test/trial they come from.  Multiple trial directories should be stored in a direcotry pertaining to the test.

Simply run imgproc.py and choose the directory you wish to run the scripts over.  It will ask what type of test and if the directory chosen was a single test or a directory for multiple ones.
